##SFML_Shapes##

Specification:
Read the description of the shapes from a configuration file and draw them to the screen. Each shape will have a name position speed color as well as properties unique to each shape style.

The shapes will have to bounce of the wall which mean when the left side of a shape its the left side of the window the X speed is reversed. If the top hits the top the Y speed reverses.

Each shape name should be drown on the exact center of the shape in the given font size and color specified in the file.

Implement an ImGui user interface which is able to:
    list all the shapes and select any one of them to edit their properties
    toggle wether or not the selected shape will be drawn
    change the scale of the shape (0 to 4)
    change the x and y velocity (-8 to 8)
    change the color
    change the name
